# Introduction

Welcome to the <b>Blockaviation API!</b> You can use our API to access the Blockaviation API endpoints, which can allow you to search, retrieve authenticated aircraft records for your application.

We have language bindings in Shell, Ruby, Python, and JavaScript! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.


# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'blockav'

api = Blockav::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```python
import blockav

api = blockav.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const blockav = require('blockav');

let api = blockav.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Blockaviation uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Blockav API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Blockaviation expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
</aside>

# Records

## Get All Records

```ruby
require 'blockav'

api = Blockav::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')

api.records.get()
```

```shell
curl "http://example.com/api/records"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const blockav = require('blockav');

let api = blockav.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
let records = api.records.get();
